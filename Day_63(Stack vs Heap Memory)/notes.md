# Day 63 — Stack vs Heap Memory

Today I learned how programs use Stack and Heap memory to manage data and execution.

## 🧠 Stack Memory

Stack memory stores:
- Function calls  
- Local variables  
- Parameters  
- Return addresses  

Characteristics:
- Very fast  
- Limited size  
- Automatically managed  
- Uses LIFO order  

Stack overflow occurs when too many function calls are made.

## 🧠 Heap Memory

Heap memory stores:
- Objects  
- Dynamic data  
- Long-living values  

Characteristics:
- Large memory area  
- Slower than stack  
- Managed by garbage collector  
- Used for flexible memory allocation

## 💡 Key Insight

Stack is fast and limited.  
Heap is flexible and large.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

- Prevents memory leaks  
- Improves debugging  
- Helps understand program crashes  
- Builds system-level thinking  

---

## 🏁 Summary

Understanding Stack vs Heap helps write safer and faster programs.
