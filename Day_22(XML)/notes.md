# Day 22 – XML (Extensible Markup Language)

Today I learned about XML, one of the most widely used data representation formats in web services, configuration files, mobile apps, and enterprise software. XML is structured, strict, and designed to store and transport data in a platform-independent way.

## 📘 What is XML?

XML stands for **Extensible Markup Language**.  
It is used to structure and organize data in a readable, hierarchical format.

- Not a programming language  
- Allows custom tags  
- Both human-readable and machine-readable  
- Stores data in a **tree structure** (hierarchical format)

## 🧠 Why XML?

XML became popular because it solved the problem of **data sharing between different systems** — platforms, languages, and technologies.

Even today, XML still powers:

- Banking systems  
- Government data exchanges  
- Android layouts  
- Microsoft Office documents  
- SOAP APIs  
- Configuration files

## 🏗 Structure of XML

XML contains:

- A **root element**  
- Nested **child elements**  
- Closing tags  
- Case-sensitive names  

### Example:

```xml
<student>
    <name>Vipul Paswan</name>
    <age>22</age>
    <course>Computer Science</course>
</student>
