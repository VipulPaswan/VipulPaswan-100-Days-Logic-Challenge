# Day 19 – Set Data Structure in JavaScript

This folder contains my implementation of a Custom Set in JavaScript as part of my #100DaysLogicChallenge.  
A Set is a powerful data structure used for storing unique values and performing efficient mathematical operations like Union and Intersection.

## What I Learned

### Core Set Operations
- `add(element)` → Insert unique values  
- `has(element)` → Check if an element exists  
- `remove(element)` → Delete an element  
- `size()` → Return number of elements  
- `values()` → Get all elements  

### Advanced Operations
- `union(otherSet)` → Combine both sets without duplicates  
- `intersection(otherSet)` → Find common elements  
- Optimized intersection by iterating through the **smaller set first** for performance  

## Example Summary

Two sets used for testing:
Results:
- **Union:** `{1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10}`
- **Intersection:** `{4, 8}`
- **Remove:** Successfully removed elements from Set A

## Why Sets Matter

Sets are useful for:
- Removing duplicates  
- Fast membership checking  
- Optimizing algorithms  
- Hashing and graph problems  
- Competitive programming
