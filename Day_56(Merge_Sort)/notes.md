# Day 56 — Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides and merges arrays to sort data efficiently.

---

## 🧠 What is Merge Sort?

Merge Sort breaks the array into smaller halves, sorts them, and merges them to form a sorted array.

---

## 🔁 Steps

1. Divide array into two halves  
2. Sort both halves recursively  
3. Merge sorted halves  
4. Repeat until sorted

## ⚙️ Time & Space Complexity

| Case | Complexity |
|----|-----------|
| All | O(n log n) |
| Space | O(n) |

---

## 🎯 Why Merge Sort?

- Stable sorting  
- Guaranteed performance  
- Used in real systems  
- Handles large data well  

---

## 🏁 Summary

Merge Sort provides predictable and efficient sorting using divide and conquer.
