🔥 Day 54 of my #100DaysLogicChallenge
Radix Sort — Multi-Pass Digit Sorting ⚡

Today I learned Radix Sort, a powerful non-comparison sorting algorithm that sorts numbers digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.

Instead of comparing values directly, Radix Sort uses Counting Sort internally to sort digits in multiple passes.

🧠 What I learned today

✔ What Radix Sort is
✔ Why digit-wise sorting is efficient
✔ How Counting Sort is used internally
✔ Multi-pass sorting technique
✔ Stability importance in sorting
✔ Why Radix Sort is faster than comparison sorts for integers

Radix Sort is a perfect example of breaking big problems into smaller predictable steps.

💡 How Radix Sort Works (Concept)

Find the maximum number

Sort numbers based on unit digit

Then tens digit

Then hundreds digit

Continue until all digits are processed

Each pass uses Counting Sort to keep the order stable.

⚙️ Time & Space Complexity
Metric	Value
Time	O(n × d)
Space	O(n + k)

n → number of elements
d → number of digits
k → digit range (0–9)
