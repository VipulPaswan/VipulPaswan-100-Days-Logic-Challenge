# Day 71 — Closures in Python

Today I learned how closures allow functions to remember values from their outer scope even after execution.

## 🧠 What is a Closure?

A closure is a function that retains access to variables from its outer function even after the outer function has returned.

## 🎯 Why Closures Matter

- Avoid global variables  
- Keep data private  
- Improve modularity  
- Used in decorators & callbacks

## 🏁 Summary

Closures help functions remember data securely and efficiently.
