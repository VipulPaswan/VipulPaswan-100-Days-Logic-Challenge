# Day 73 — Memory Management in C++ vs Python

Today I compared how memory is handled in C++ and Python.

---

## 🧠 C++ Memory Management

- Manual allocation & deallocation  
- Uses new/delete  
- Faster but unsafe  
- Memory leaks possible  

---

## 🧠 Python Memory Management

- Automatic garbage collection  
- Uses reference counting  
- Safer but slower  
- Memory leaks are rare  

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

- Explains speed differences  
- Prevents memory bugs  
- Helps choose right language  

---

## 🏁 Summary

C++ gives speed.  
Python gives safety.
