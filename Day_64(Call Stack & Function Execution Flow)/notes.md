# Day 64 — Call Stack & Function Execution Flow

Today I studied how the Call Stack manages function execution inside a program.

---

## 🧠 What is Call Stack?

The call stack is a memory structure that keeps track of active function calls.

---

## 🔁 How Call Stack Works

1. When a function is called, it is pushed onto the stack  
2. Local variables are stored  
3. When the function ends, it is popped from the stack  
4. Control returns to the previous function  

It follows LIFO (Last In, First Out).

## 🎯 Why Call Stack is Important

- Controls execution order  
- Helps debug recursion  
- Explains stack overflow errors  
- Makes program flow predictable  

---

## 💡 Key Insight

Programs don’t run magically — they move step by step through the call stack.

---

## 🏁 Summary

Call Stack is the hidden engine behind every running program.
